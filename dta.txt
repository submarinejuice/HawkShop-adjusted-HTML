                                achievement.</li>

                                <li>Students are notified prior to the start of classes, by email that their course is
                                  participating in the Digital Textbook Access model.</li>
                                <li>Access is provided automatically for every student enrolled in the course on the first

                                <li>Students can access the digital resources for 2 weeks at no charge, during which time
                                  they can opt out if they choose wish to source the resource elsewhere through My Learning
                                  Space or through the links in the e-mails we send participating students.</li>
