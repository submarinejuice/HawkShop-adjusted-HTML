**Course_materials.css & course-materials_landing.html** are course material pages. 
**student_info_landing.html uses course_materials.css as well.**
**textbooks 101 _laurier.html uses textbookcss.css**
fonts is a font download css file in case. (for lato)
jquery file is a file i added for functionaity of the navigation menu because i do not have access to the jquery provided that i assume would be in the netsuite already. (only added for local host testing purposes)
all other js files should already be on the netsuite. Added to this just in case.
**All html pages use their own stylesheet relative to that page, in addition to the shopping_2.css template given**

Here are some notes:
- netsuite has a particular way of connecting pages, not using the same paths that I currently have in place to link my worked on files to the website, as I am currently using
  local pathways for adjusted files (file locations on my local folder) instead of paths that connect all the other pre existing pages
- **would not reccomend deployment yet,** as we need to go manually into netsuite and update all the page, image, and maybe even video links as I tested everything on a local host
meaning I was not using proper netsuite documentations, IDK what would happen if you were to upload as of right now.
- customizability of images and text, unsure of how the deployment would work because I don't have access, we can try staging it first and linking everything in netsuite.
- there are courses to take on netsuite for this specifically that are like 1-2 hours long but you need permission from company
- on the students tab on the laurier website the email is wrong for the hawkshop
